			<h1>Plane Landing Video</h1>
			<p>This is a video I shot while flying into Miami international. The flight was a bit hectic because of a few events that took place in flight. First off, the pilot locked himself out of the cockpit and delayed the flight about an hour "mind you, we were already 24 hours delayed from the night before". Then, in flight, we had some crazy turbulence. We were thrown around like I have never experienced inside of that airplane. During our downward descent into Miami international we had to take three passes over the landing strip before we were able to touch down, and finally during the landing there was an emergency in one of the seats. If you can listen closely to the video you can actually hear the flight attendant speaking to the person. 
			<p>I was nervose during that flight. I almost got off the plane because i'm a paranoid passenger and details like an incompetent pilot eat away at me. I was freaking out the whole flight. Then during the turbulence all i could figure was that it was the incompetent captain flying through no-go zones. who knows what the truth really was, I was left to assume so I assumed the worst. 
			And then during the three passes to land I thought he was going to drop us in the middle of the ocean a couple of times. All in all, I feel that I"m lucky to be alive having survived the incompetence  of one pilot behind the wheel of a Airbus A300-600.</p>
